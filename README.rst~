This ajaxfilemanager based on *python-django*!

Released with **Django 1.5**

Install
=======

It's easy:

1. Copy the complete App [1]_ folder into your project folder
2. Add the App to the INSTALLED_APPS
3. Insert the path to the "template" directory in the "ajaxfilemanager"
    folder into your TEMPLATE_DIRS
4. Add a URL-Rule to your urls.py in the django-site-root
    Example:
    url(r^'ajaxfilemanager/', include('ajaxfilemanager.urls')),
5. Ensure that you activate 'staticfiles'
 
Finish!

Usage
=====

Serve to 'http://your.server.com/ajaxfilemanager'. You will be 
redirect to 'http://your.server.com/ajaxfilemanager/?path=/'.
The Path Syntax in the URL is simple. The '/' is the ajaxfm_media_root. 
The rest is the original path. Currently you can access the uploader 
with "http://your.server.com/ajaxfilemanager/upload" this is still a
security leak, because anyone can upload without have access to the
filemanager. 

TODO
====

* "Access denied" for direct usage of /upload.
* Watch the media directory for changes and add them immediately to 
   page.
